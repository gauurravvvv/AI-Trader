"""PaperBackend — DESIGNED-FOR STUB (spec §4.2, Phase B).

Paper trading has no execution path in the codebase today: AlpacaPaperTradingClient
is read-only and there is no order-submission or step loop. Building this means real
new code (live order submission, a realtime decision-cadence scheduler, live bar
assembly) and needs its own design pass. This stub exists so the parity seam is real
and the eventual drop-in is mechanical.
